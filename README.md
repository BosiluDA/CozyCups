CozyCups

CozyCups is a PHP-based e-commerce website developed during my 1st Year, 2nd Semester for the Web Application Development (WAD) module. It was my first solo project, where I built a complete online mug shop from scratch.

The platform allows users to browse themed mugs (Funny, Christmas, Love, Birthday), add items to their cart, manage quantities, and complete a checkout process. It also includes user authentication (sign up, login, logout, profile management) and a session-based wishlist feature.

Tech Stack: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with session-based authentication and cart management).

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development, database integration, and building a functional e-commerce workflow independently.
